# File-system
This code defines an in-memory file system simulation in Python. It includes classes and methods for creating, navigating, and manipulating directories and files, similar to a Unix-like file system. Functionality:

Classes:
InMemoryFileSystem- Manages the file system, including the root directory and current working directory.
Provides methods for common file system operations.

Directory:
Represents a directory in the file system.
Contains a list of entries (files and subdirectories).
Provides methods to add, remove, find, and list entries.
File

Represents a file in the file system.
Contains file contents and methods to display, write, search within, and clone the file.

Methods in InMemoryFileSystem:
mkdir(name): Creates a new directory with the given name in the current directory.
cd(path): Changes the current working directory to the specified path.
ls(path="."): Lists entries in the specified directory (or current directory by default).
grep(pattern, filename): Searches for a pattern in the specified file and prints matching lines.
cat(filename): Displays the contents of the specified file.
touch(filename): Creates a new empty file with the specified name in the current directory.
echo(text, filename): Writes text to the specified file (overwrites existing content).
mv(source_path, destination_path): Moves an entry from source path to destination path.
cp(source_path, destination_path="."): Copies an entry from source path to destination path.
rm(path): Removes the entry at the specified path.
save_state(filename="filesystem_state.pkl"): Saves the current state of the file system to a file using pickle.
load_state(filename="filesystem_state.pkl"): Loads the file system state from a file using pickle.

Methods in Directory
add_entry(entry): Adds a file or subdirectory to the directory.
remove_entry(entry): Removes a file or subdirectory from the directory.
find_entry_by_path(path): Finds and returns an entry (file or directory) by its path.
find_directory_by_path(path): Finds and returns a directory by its path.
find_entry_by_name(name): Finds and returns an entry by its name.
list_entries(): Lists the names of all entries in the directory.

Methods in File
display_contents(): Displays the contents of the file.
write_text(text): Writes text to the file (overwrites existing content).
grep(pattern): Searches for a pattern in the file and prints matching lines along with line numbers.
clone(): Creates a copy of the file with the same name and contents.


Example Usage Part 1:


Creating and Managing Directories and Files(Python):
fs = InMemoryFileSystem()
fs.mkdir("dir1")
fs.cd("dir1")
fs.touch("file1.txt")
fs.echo("Hello, world!", "file1.txt")
fs.cat("file1.txt")


Saving and Loading File System State(Python):
fs.save_state()
fs.load_state()


Example usage Part 2: 
1. Create an instance of InMemoryFileSystem (fs).
2. Perform various operations on the in-memory file system, including: B.
3. Create directories and files, move directories, and edit file contents.
4. This in-memory file system example provides a basic representation of a file system.
